## The Diabetes Risk Score

- Introduced by Jaana Lindström and Jaakko Tuomilehto
  (paper available [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12610029)).
- Attempts to identify individuals at a high risk of developing the disease
  without laboratory tests.
- Based on age, body mass index, waist circumference, history of
  antihypertensive drug treatment and high blood glucose, physical activity,
  and daily consumption of fruits, berries, or vegetables.
- Score goes from 0 (lowest risk) to 20 (highest risk).
- It also computes an associated probability of developing diabetes within ten years.
- There are some caveats; e.g., family history of diabetes is not taken
  into account (see paper!).

## Usage

```{r, echo=FALSE}
diabetesRisk <- function(sex, age, bmi, waist, bpm, hbg, pa, vfb) {
    # Coefficients
    beta <- c(0.650, 0.940, 0.015, 0.938, 1.021, 1.424, 0.714, 2.263, 0.268, 0.165)
    # Scores
    s <- c(2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 1)
    # Initialize all variables to zero
    x <- numeric(10)
    # Age (years)
    if (age >= 45 & age < 55) x[1] <- 1
    if (age >= 55) x[2] <- 1
    # BMI (kg/m^2)
    if (bmi > 25 & bmi <= 30) x[3] <- 1
    if (bmi > 30) x[4] <- 1
    # Waist circumference (cm)
    if (sex == "M" & waist >= 94 & waist < 102) x[5] <- 1
    if (sex == "M" & waist >= 102) x[6] <- 1
    if (sex == "F" & waist >= 80 & waist < 88) x[5] <- 1
    if (sex == "F" & waist >= 88) x[6] <- 1
    # Use of blood pressure medication
    if (bpm) x[7] <- 1
    # History of high blood glucose
    if (hbg) x[8] <- 1
    # Physical activity (at least 4 hours/week)
    if (pa == FALSE) x[9] <- 1
    # Daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, or berries
    if (vfb == FALSE) x[10] <- 1
    score <- drop(x %*% s)
    t <- -5.658 + drop(x %*% beta)
    sigma <- 1/(1 + exp(-t))
    c(as.integer(score), sigma)
}

bmiCalc <- function(height, weight) {
    weight/height^2
}
```

Users supply their data via the input widgets on the left panel.
Height and weight are used to compute the body mass index (BMI).
Here's an example calculation:
```{r}
sex <- "M"
age <- 38
height <- 172   # in centimeters
weight <- 78    # in kilograms
bmi <- bmiCalc(height, weight)
waist <- 90     # in centimeters
bpm <- FALSE    # Blood pressure medication?
hbg <- FALSE    # High blood glucose?
pa <- FALSE     # Physical activity at least 4 hours per week?
vfb <- TRUE     # Daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, or berries?
diabetesRisk(sex, age, bmi, waist, bpm, hbg, pa, vfb)
```

## Inner workings

- Each variable contributes to the score according to the specifications
  given by Lindström and Tuomilehto in their paper.
- The `diabetesRisk()` function returns the score and an associated probability,
  computed with the formula
  $$p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}},$$
  where $t = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{2} + \cdots$.
- The $\beta$-coefficients come from a logistic regression model.
